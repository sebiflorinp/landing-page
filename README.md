# landing-page
In this project I'll put into practice knowledge that I have learned in the CSS section of The Odin Project course such as basic styling, the flexbox model and using divs (that are required for the flexbox). This will be a test webpage, thereby this page won't serve any practical purpose besides showing off what I've learned.
